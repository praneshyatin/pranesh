<h3> HOW TO PLAN AND ORGANIZE YOUR DAY </h3>
<p>
	If you’re always rushing around trying to get things done, it might be time for you to better organize your day.<br>
 Organizing is a fairly personal activity, but it does involve some basics.<br> You’ll want to determine the activities you need to accomplish, create an effective schedule, and work to stay organized. With a bit of effort and time, your routine will become habit and you’ll make your days more efficient and successful.
<ol>
	<li>Determining Your Activities</li>
	<p>Write down what you do. Grab a notebook and a pen that you will carry with you for a few days.<br> Write down any activities you engage in, including work, errands, taking care of yourself, and having fun. Include how often you usually do these actions</p>

	<li>Include any aspirations</li>
	<p>If there are other things that you’d like to do, but never seem to get around to, include these on your list.<br> As you organize your day, you will figure out how to include these new activities into your routine </p>

	<li> Making a Plan</li>
	<p>Once you have a list of your activities (including aspirational ones), and how often you complete each task, you must reflect on how long each activity takes.</p>
